1) In this program, I wrote to a text file, deleted it, created it again, and read it using the program.
2) I specified the statements with headlines. You can put them out of the comment to run. Don't try to run all at the same time. It won't work. 
3) We used while loop so "fgets" statement can read all the lines. If u want program to read only 1 line you can get "fgets" statement out of the while loop condition and get rid of the while loop.
